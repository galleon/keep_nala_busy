# Keep Nala Busy 🐾

**A fun and interactive project for your cat!**

Do you have a curious cat that loves to chase your cursor or tap on your keyboard? Meet Nala, my mischievous feline companion who inspired this project. To keep her entertained (and away from my workspace), I dedicated a portion of my panoramic screen to an interactive playground just for her. 🎮🐱

This project uses **pygame** to create a visually engaging experience for cats, with moving shapes and objects that keep them captivated. It's a great way to redirect your cat's attention while you focus on your tasks!

## Features 🐾

- 🎨 **Colorful Animations**: Moving shapes and interactive objects designed to catch your cat's attention.
- 🖥️ **Screen Segmentation**: The playground runs on a designated portion of your screen, leaving the rest for your work.
- 🐾 **Cat-Friendly**: Tested and approved by Nala herself!

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/galleon/keep_nala_busy.git
   cd keep_nala_busy
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Use `uv` (a tool to bootstrap and manage Python virtual environments) to create a virtual environment for the project:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   Launch the interactive playground for your cat:
   ```bash
   uv run python nala.py

## How It Works 🎮

The project is built using **pygame**, a Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. It renders animations on the screen to catch your cat's attention. You can customize the behavior of the playground, such as the size of the screen area dedicated to the animations or the types of objects displayed.

## Customization 🛠️

You can tweak the project to suit your cat's preferences:

- **Screen Area**: Adjust the portion of the screen used by modifying the screen settings in the code.
- **Animations**: Add new shapes or animations to keep your cat engaged.
- **Sound Effects**: Optionally add sound effects (if your cat enjoys them).
